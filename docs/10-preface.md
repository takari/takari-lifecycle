# Preface

Welcome to the book about the Takari Extensions for Apache Maven TEAM and
related tools and projects. We hope you will find this book to be a useful
resource for getting started with TEAM and learning more about getting the most
out of the advanced features it offers.

## Welcome from Jason van Zyl

Maven has been around for over 10 years. The idea for the project predates the
release by several years, but the tool you know as Maven has had a 10th birthday
this year. During that decade, while the tool has changed, the core assumptions
and conventions have stood the test of time. Ten years later, Maven is used in
some of the biggest projects in the industry, and the tool has helped to create
a healthy ecosystem of open source development, because it made it easy to share
components.

The existence of a central repository for Java components is something all Java
developers are now used to, and Maven was the project that established the first
central repository for Java. The idea of convention over configuration for Java
projects remains important to the projects I work with every day, almost 10
years later. Other build tools have attempted to create new standards and build
conventions, yet Maven still provides the best balance between convention and
flexibility.

If you want your organization to focus on delivering software and if you want
to avoid creating custom build scripts that are difficult to understand and
maintain, you use Maven. It provides a model that is easy to understand, and it
can be adapted to meet most requirements.

What also became clear over these 10 years is that Maven's conventions are
not for everyone, and this is to be expected. When I hear that people are
dissatisfied with Maven or when people call it inflexible and broken, I agree.
Maven isn't aiming to be everything to every build engineer. If you don't follow
the conventions it has clearly outlined, it is inflexible or broken. The tool is
opinionated, and if these opinions are in conflict with your own, then the
answer is to innovate.

Takari's TEAM (officially known as Takari Extensions for Apache Maven) is
Takari's attempt to address several key issues with Maven in a distribution that
is aimed at large-scale projects. In my own work with Maven I came to the
realization that it was time to build a set of extensions and customizations on
top of Maven that would allow it to stay as strong over the next ten years as it
has been over the last.

While features like incremental builds and faster parallel builds will
certainly be relevant to all Maven users, these features have been designed to
address the needs of building at scale.

## Who is this book for?

This book is written for users who have experience with Maven. While Takari
does offer Maven training for users, this book will assume that you are familiar
with basic Maven concepts such as the POM or the Maven Lifecycle. With TEAM,
Takari wanted to make sure that we were focused on addressing critical gaps in
Maven's core and Maven's plugins. Good Maven documentation isn't one of these
gaps, and if you are looking for practical information about Maven's basic
concepts, we encourage you to browse the Maven project web site at
http://maven.apache.org

This book is written for someone currently using Maven or for someone
evaluating using the TEAM distribution to improve an existing Maven build.

## How to read this book

The TEAM book has been written as a comprehensive reference to the features
offered by TEAM. If you are new to TEAM we encourage you to read the introduction,
but if you are only interested in learning how to use a specific feature or
plugin you will be able to skip to an individual chapter and get started.

We wrote each chapter as a stand-alone document that can be used independent of
other parts of this book, and when necessary we will include a cross-reference
to a related section in another chapter.

## How to Contact Takari

Takari is available if you have questions about the TEAM distribution, questions
about support, or if you have a suggestion for a new feature. We're very
interested in your feedback and suggestions.

Our website at http://takari.io/ contains numerous resources that might be of
interest to you

To get in touch with Takari, we encourage you to send an email to
team@takari.io

### Takari Maven Training

Takari offers virtual training for Maven and custom training classes for
Takari's TEAM distribution.

Takari's Introduction to Maven is a virtual training course that was designed
to focus on practice rather than theory. The course is designed to bring
everyone up to a base line of knowledge of Maven so teams can collaborate on
projects more effectively.

For more information about Takari's Maven training, email training@takari.io.

### Takari Subscription

Takari offers support for Maven and the TEAM distribution with a subscription to
the TEAM distribution. If your organization depends on Takari, we encourage you
to subscribe to our commercial offering for the latest updates and information
about the TEAM distribution as well as for early-access to features included in
the TEAM distribution.

With a Takari subscription you'll have the ability to receive direct support
from Takari's team of open source experts.

## Acknowledgements

The authors of this book would like to acknowledge the customers of Takari for
supporting sustainable open source development.
