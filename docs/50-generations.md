# Generations

## Introduction

Generations is a form of continuous delivery for Maven. Takari has been working on this tooling with Salesforce over the last year and it's something we plan to release as soon as we can. The support consists of extensions for Maven and a stand-alone server that supports the generations deployment model. We are considering creating plugins for Nexus and Artifactory but are as of yet undecided. We hope to have more here soon.
