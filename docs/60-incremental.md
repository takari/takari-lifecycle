# Incremental Build Support Library

## Introduction

The incremental build support of the Takari lifecycle is available as a generic library to enhance other Maven plugins and tools by enabling incremental builds. We have rewritten this API several times over the last year but the [Takari Lifecycle][1] itself serves as the best, up-to-date, of the current APIs.

If you want to use the incremental support library in your own Maven plugin, the usage of the library in the Takari Lifecycle and the [project source itself][2] are a good starting point.
